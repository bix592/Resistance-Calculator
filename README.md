# Resistance-Calculator

Made for school project which applies data structure, graphs, and shortest path algorithms. Receives input of resistor network in netlist representation which is technically an edge list of a graph.

The program can:
1. identify which resistors are in series and which resistors are in parallel.
2. identify all resistors in series or in parallel with each other and calculate the equivalent resistance for each group of resistors
3. find the equivalent resistance between two nodes assuming that the resistor network can be simplified by only using multiple
 iterations of series and parallel combinations
